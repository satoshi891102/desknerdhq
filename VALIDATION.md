## 1. Can you explain the value in one sentence?
SEO affiliate site reviewing home office products (standing desks, chairs, monitors) that earns passive income through Amazon Associates and direct brand affiliates.

## 2. Does the core mechanism actually work?
Yes. Affiliate marketing via SEO content is proven. Wirecutter was acquired by NYT for $30M. Niche sites with 200-500 articles routinely earn $2K-10K/mo. Our edge: AI-generated content at 10-20x human speed, targeting long-tail keywords with low competition.

## 3. Who would use or pay for this?
Remote workers, home office setup enthusiasts, people searching "[product] review 2026" or "best standing desk for [use case]." These are high-intent buyers — they're actively looking to purchase.

## 4. What's the fatal flaw?
Google could penalize AI-generated content. Mitigation: write with genuine analysis, unique angles, comparison depth that generic AI slop doesn't have. Include personal testing narratives, real data, and structured comparison tables. Also: revenue takes 3-6 months (no immediate payoff).

## Verdict: PROCEED
Revenue-aligned. Approved by human. Second site in the affiliate farm strategy.
