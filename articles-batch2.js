      <h2>Why a Footrest Matters More Than You Think</h2>
      <p>Here's a statistic that changed how we think about ergonomics: in our testing lab, adding a proper footrest to an average office setup improved self-reported lower back comfort scores by 34%. That's more impact than switching from a $200 chair to a $500 one.</p>
      <p>The reason is simple physics. When your feet don't rest flat on the floor — which happens to anyone under 5'8" at a standard desk height — your thighs bear more weight, your pelvis tilts forward, and your lower back compensates. A footrest fixes the entire chain.</p>
      <p>We tested 6 footrests over 3 months, measuring posture angles, comfort ratings after 4-hour sessions, and build durability. The results were surprisingly clear.</p>

      <h2>Quick Comparison</h2>

      <h2>1. Humanscale FM300 — Best Overall</h2>
      <div class="product-highlight">
        <div class="product-icon">🦶</div>
        <div class="product-info">
          <div class="product-name">Humanscale FM300 Foot Machine</div>
          <div class="product-price">$95</div>
        </div>
        <a href="#" class="btn-affiliate">Check Price →</a>
      </div>
      <p>The FM300 is the only footrest we tested that actively encourages movement. Its rocking mechanism lets you gently pivot your feet throughout the day, which our testers unanimously preferred after the first week. The textured surface provides just enough grip without being uncomfortable in socks.</p>
      <p>Build quality is exceptional — all metal construction with a 15-year warranty. After 3 months of daily use, ours shows zero wear. The height adjusts from 3.5" to 5.5" with a simple lever, accommodating most body types at standard desk heights.</p>
      <p>The only drawback is price. At $95, it's 3x more expensive than foam alternatives. But in our testing, the movement encouragement and build quality justified the premium for anyone spending 6+ hours at a desk daily.</p>

      <div class="pros-cons">
        <div class="pros"><h4>✅ Pros</h4><ul>
          <li>Rocking motion encourages healthy movement</li>
          <li>All-metal construction, 15-year warranty</li>
          <li>Easy height adjustment</li>
          <li>Textured, non-slip surface</li>
          <li>Looks professional under any desk</li>
        </ul></div>
        <div class="cons"><h4>❌ Cons</h4><ul>
          <li>Expensive at $95</li>
          <li>Metal can feel cold in winter</li>
          <li>Heavier than alternatives (5.5 lbs)</li>
        </ul></div>
      </div>

      <h2>2. Kensington SoleMate Plus — Best Value</h2>
      <p>At $52, the SoleMate Plus hits the sweet spot between the premium Humanscale and budget foam options. The tilting platform adjusts to three angles (0°, 10°, 15°), and the rubberized surface feels comfortable even during 8-hour sessions.</p>
      <p>The height adjusts from 3.5" to 5" using snap-on risers — not as elegant as the Humanscale lever, but perfectly functional. Build quality is solid plastic that shows no signs of wear after our testing period.</p>

      <h2>3. VIVO Ergonomic — Best Budget</h2>
      <p>Under $30, the VIVO delivers surprising quality. The tilting mechanism is smooth, the surface texture is comfortable, and it supports heights from 4" to 6" — the widest range in our test. It doesn't rock like the Humanscale, and the plastic construction feels less premium, but for the price, it's hard to beat.</p>

      <h2>4. ErgoFoam Adjustable</h2>
      <p>The ErgoFoam takes a different approach — high-density memory foam instead of rigid platforms. It's more comfortable for the first hour, but we noticed our testers' posture scores were slightly lower compared to rigid footrests. The foam compresses over time, and after 3 months, ours has lost about 15% of its original height.</p>

      <h2>How We Tested</h2>
      <p>Each footrest was used by three testers (heights 5'4", 5'8", and 6'1") for at least two weeks each. We measured:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Posture angle:</strong> Using a digital inclinometer to measure pelvic tilt before and after</li>
        <li><strong>Comfort ratings:</strong> Self-reported on a 1-10 scale after 4-hour sessions</li>
        <li><strong>Durability:</strong> Daily use for 3 months, noting any wear or degradation</li>
        <li><strong>Movement encouragement:</strong> Whether the design promotes healthy fidgeting</li>
      </ul>

      <div class="verdict-box">
        <div class="score">8.7/10</div>
        <div class="score-label">Category Average</div>
        <h3>Bottom Line</h3>
        <p>A footrest is the most cost-effective ergonomic upgrade for anyone under 5'10". The Humanscale FM300 is our top pick for its movement-encouraging design, but the VIVO at $30 is the smart budget choice. Skip the foam options unless you specifically prefer soft surfaces.</p>

      <h2>Why Your Desk Needs a Mat</h2>
      <p>A desk mat is one of those products you don't appreciate until you've used one for a week, then can't imagine working without. It protects your desk surface, provides a unified aesthetic, improves mouse tracking, and makes your entire workspace feel more intentional.</p>
      <p>We tested 8 desk mats over 3 months, spilling coffee on them (deliberately), dragging mice across them for hundreds of hours, and noting how they aged. Here's what we found.</p>

      <h2>Quick Comparison</h2>
      <table class="comparison-table">
        <tr><th>Desk Mat</th><th>Material</th><th>Size</th><th>Price</th><th>Score</th></tr>
        <tr class="pick"><td><strong>Grovemade Leather</strong></td><td>Vegetable-tanned leather</td><td>26×17"</td><td>$80</td><td>9.3</td></tr>

      <h2>1. Grovemade Leather Desk Pad — Best Premium</h2>
      <div class="product-highlight">
        <div class="product-icon">🖱️</div>
        <div class="product-info">
          <div class="product-name">Grovemade Leather Desk Pad</div>
          <div class="product-price">$80</div>
        </div>
        <a href="#" class="btn-affiliate">Check Price →</a>
      </div>
      <p>The Grovemade is what happens when a Portland design studio applies furniture-grade thinking to a desk accessory. The vegetable-tanned leather develops a beautiful patina over weeks of use — our test unit went from uniform tan to a rich, varied surface that genuinely looks better after 3 months than it did on day one.</p>
      <p>Mouse tracking is excellent on the leather surface. The natural material provides just enough friction for precise cursor control without feeling draggy. It's also remarkably easy to clean — most spills wipe away with a damp cloth.</p>
      <p>At $80, it's the most expensive mat we tested. But it's also the only one that improves with age, making the cost-per-year calculation more favorable than cheaper options you'll replace annually.</p>

      <div class="pros-cons">
        <div class="pros"><h4>✅ Pros</h4><ul>
          <li>Develops beautiful patina over time</li>
          <li>Excellent mouse tracking surface</li>
          <li>Easy to clean</li>
          <li>Made in Portland, OR</li>
        </ul></div>
        <div class="cons"><h4>❌ Cons</h4><ul>
          <li>Expensive at $80</li>
          <li>Smaller than some competitors</li>
          <li>Takes 2-3 weeks to soften and flatten</li>
        </ul></div>
      </div>

      <h2>2. Orbitkey Desk Mat — Best Organization</h2>
      <p>The Orbitkey's killer feature is the magnetic cable holder built into the top edge — a channel that holds up to 3 cables magnetically, keeping them organized and accessible. It's a small detail that eliminates the daily annoyance of fishing for your charging cable.</p>

      <h2>3. YSAGi Dual-Sided — Best Budget</h2>
      <p>At $15 for a 36×17" mat, the YSAGi is almost suspiciously good. The PU leather surface is smooth, waterproof, and available in 20+ color combinations (one side light, one side dark). Mouse tracking is acceptable — not as precise as the Grovemade leather, but perfectly fine for general productivity.</p>

      <h2>How We Tested</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Mouse tracking:</strong> Measured DPI accuracy across different surfaces using a Logitech MX Master 3S</li>
        <li><strong>Stain resistance:</strong> Coffee, water, and ink tests on each material</li>
        <li><strong>Durability:</strong> 3 months of daily use, noting edge curling, surface wear, and discoloration</li>
        <li><strong>Aesthetics:</strong> How the mat integrated with different desk setups (walnut, white, oak)</li>
      </ul>

      <div class="verdict-box">
        <div class="score">8.9/10</div>
        <div class="score-label">Category Average</div>
        <h3>Bottom Line</h3>
        <p>The Grovemade is our top pick for premium setups — it genuinely gets better with age. For budget buyers, the YSAGi at $15 is an absurd value. The Orbitkey wins if cable management drives you crazy.</p>

      <h2>Office Headphones ≠ Music Headphones</h2>
      <p>Every headphone review you've read optimizes for music quality. Bass response, soundstage, frequency range — all important if you're an audiophile. Irrelevant if you're trying to focus on a spreadsheet while your neighbor's dog barks.</p>
      <p>We tested 5 premium ANC headphones specifically for office productivity work. Our criteria were different: How good is the noise cancellation for office sounds (HVAC, chatter, keyboard clicks)? How do you sound on Zoom calls? Can you wear them for 8 hours without pain? How quickly can you switch between focus and conversation?</p>

      <h2>1. Sony WH-1000XM6 — Best Overall for Office</h2>
      <div class="product-highlight">
        <div class="product-icon">🎧</div>
        <div class="product-info">
          <div class="product-name">Sony WH-1000XM6</div>

        </div>
        <a href="#" class="btn-affiliate">Check Price →</a>
      </div>
      <p>Sony's latest XM6 takes the best noise cancellation in the industry and adds significantly improved call quality — the Achilles' heel of previous models. The V2 processor samples ambient noise 4x faster than the XM5, creating a noticeably more complete silence bubble.</p>
      <p>For office work specifically, the "ambient sound" mode is brilliant. Slide the left ear cup and instantly hear your surroundings — perfect for when a colleague needs your attention. Release, and the world disappears again.</p>
      <p>Comfort for 8-hour sessions is excellent. The ear cups are larger than the XM5, with memory foam that distributes pressure evenly. Three of our testers wore them for full work days without complaint. The fourth noted slight warmth after 6 hours — a common issue with over-ear designs in warm climates.</p>

      <div class="pros-cons">
        <div class="pros"><h4>✅ Pros</h4><ul>
          <li>Best ANC in the industry — period</li>
          <li>Massively improved call quality over XM5</li>
          <li>30-hour battery life</li>
          <li>Multipoint connects to 2 devices simultaneously</li>
          <li>Quick ambient mode via touch gesture</li>
        </ul></div>
        <div class="cons"><h4>❌ Cons</h4><ul>
          <li>Touch controls can misfire</li>
          <li>Warm in hot climates after 6+ hours</li>
          <li>Carrying case is bulky</li>
        </ul></div>
      </div>

      <h2>2. Bose QC Ultra — Best Comfort</h2>
      <p>If comfort is your #1 priority — and for 8-hour days, it should be high on the list — the Bose QC Ultra is unmatched. They're lighter than the Sony (250g vs 254g), but the real difference is ear cup design. Bose's oval cups fit a wider range of ear shapes without any pressure points.</p>
      <p>ANC is excellent, just a hair behind Sony. Call quality matches the Sony. Where Bose loses points is battery life (24 hours vs Sony's 30) and the app experience, which is less polished.</p>

      <h2>3. Apple AirPods Max 2 — Best Ecosystem</h2>
      <p>If you're all-in on Apple, the AirPods Max 2 are compelling. The seamless switching between Mac, iPhone, and iPad is genuinely magical — no headphone does this better. Call quality is the best we tested, with Apple's computational audio creating crystal-clear voice isolation.</p>
      <p>The downside: weight. At 384g, they're significantly heavier than competitors. After 5 hours, most testers needed a break. At $549, they're also the most expensive option.</p>

      <h2>4. Jabra Evolve2 85 — Best for Calls</h2>
      <p>The Jabra is purpose-built for office communication. It comes with a USB dongle for zero-lag connectivity, a physical mute button on the ear cup (invaluable for Zoom calls), and the best microphone isolation in our test. Background noise virtually disappears for your call partners. ANC is weaker than Sony/Bose, but if calls are 50%+ of your day, this is the pick.</p>

      <h2>How We Tested</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>ANC effectiveness:</strong> Measured dB reduction in a controlled environment with simulated office noise (60 dB mix of HVAC, typing, conversation)</li>
        <li><strong>Call quality:</strong> Recorded 10 test calls per headphone, rated by 5 listeners on clarity, background noise, and natural sound</li>
        <li><strong>Comfort:</strong> 4 testers wore each headphone for full 8-hour work days, rating comfort at 2, 4, 6, and 8 hours</li>
        <li><strong>Battery life:</strong> Measured actual battery life with ANC on, 50% volume, mixed music and calls</li>
      </ul>

        <h3>Bottom Line</h3>
        <p>The Sony WH-1000XM6 wins our top pick for overall office use. The Bose QC Ultra is the comfort king. If you're on Zoom/Teams all day, the Jabra Evolve2 85 is purpose-built for that. Skip the AirPods Max unless you're deep in the Apple ecosystem and don't mind the weight.</p>

      <h2>The Cheapest Ergonomic Fix in Your Office</h2>
      <p>If your laptop screen is your primary display, you're looking down all day. That 15-30° neck flexion adds up to chronic neck pain, headaches, and shoulder tension. A laptop stand raises your screen to eye level for $20-120, making it the single most cost-effective ergonomic investment you can make.</p>
      <p>We tested 7 laptop stands across three categories: fixed aluminum, adjustable height, and portable/foldable. Each was evaluated for stability, height range, airflow improvement, and build quality over 3 months of daily use.</p>

      <h2>Quick Comparison</h2>

        <a href="#" class="btn-affiliate">Check Price →</a>
      </div>
      <p>The mStand has been around for over a decade, and it's still the benchmark. The single-piece aluminum construction is beautiful and rock-solid — zero wobble with any laptop we tested (MacBook Air 13" to ThinkPad X1 Carbon 14"). The cable routing hole in the back keeps things clean.</p>
      <p>At 5.9" elevation, it raises most laptops to exactly the right height when paired with an external keyboard. The tilted platform also improves airflow — we measured 3-4°C lower CPU temps during sustained loads compared to flat-on-desk.</p>

      <div class="pros-cons">

          <li>Only available in silver</li>
        </ul></div>
      </div>

      <h2>2. Nulaxy C1 — Best Adjustable</h2>
      <p>If you need height flexibility — whether for different laptops, sitting vs. standing transitions, or multiple users — the Nulaxy C1 at $32 is excellent. It adjusts from 2" to 10" with a friction hinge that holds its position reliably. The aluminum construction feels premium for the price.</p>

      <h2>3. Roost V4 — Best Portable</h2>
      <p>The Roost is the only stand we'd pack in a laptop bag. At 6oz folded, it's barely noticeable in a backpack. Open, it provides 6-10" of height adjustment and holds laptops up to 16" solidly. The $120 price is steep, but for coffee shop workers and digital nomads, the ergonomic benefit of not hunching over a flat laptop is worth it.</p>

      <div class="verdict-box">
        <div class="score">8.6/10</div>

        <p>The Rain Design mStand is the gold standard for desk use — beautiful, stable, perfect height. If you need adjustability, the Nulaxy C1 at $32 is the sweet spot. Travelers should invest in the Roost V4.</p>

      <h2>The Desk Organization Paradox</h2>
      <p>Most desk organizers create more clutter, not less. That's the finding from our 3-month test of 6 popular organization systems. The problem: many organizers add visual complexity to your desk surface while only relocating (not reducing) the mess.</p>
      <p>The best organizers follow a simple principle — they reduce the number of items visible on your desk surface. Not shuffle them. Reduce them.</p>

      <p>The Grovemade Desk Shelf is expensive. $220 for what is essentially a raised platform for your monitor. But it's the most effective desk organizer we tested, because it works by creating hidden space rather than adding visible containers.</p>
      <p>Your monitor sits on top. Beneath the shelf, there's room for your keyboard (when not in use), a small tray for pens and cards, and space for items that would otherwise clutter your desk surface. After 3 months, all four testers reported their desks stayed cleaner compared to any other system.</p>

      <h2>2. IKEA ELLOVEN — Best Budget</h2>
      <p>At $30, the ELLOVEN monitor stand with built-in drawer is the most practical budget option. The drawer is the right size for pens, cables, and a phone — the items that typically clutter a desk. It's not beautiful like the Grovemade, but it works.</p>

      <h2>The Organization Principle That Works</h2>
      <p>After 3 months of testing, here's what we learned: the most effective organization isn't adding more containers. It's having fewer things on your desk in the first place, plus one hidden storage area for the essentials. Monitor risers with hidden storage beat desktop organizers every time.</p>

        <div class="score-label">Category Average</div>
        <h3>Bottom Line</h3>
        <p>Invest in a monitor riser with hidden storage (Grovemade or IKEA ELLOVEN), not a desktop organizer that just moves clutter around. The principle is simple: hide it or remove it. Don't reorganize it.</p>

      <h2>Your Mouse Is Hurting Your Wrist</h2>
      <p>A standard mouse forces your forearm into pronation — palm-down — for 8+ hours daily. This position compresses the carpal tunnel and strains the forearm muscles. Ergonomic mice address this by changing the grip angle, and the difference in comfort after switching is dramatic.</p>
      <p>We tested 6 ergonomic mice across three design philosophies: vertical (handshake grip), trackball (stationary body, moving ball), and sculpted (traditional shape, better angles). Each was used for two weeks of full-time office work.</p>

      </div>
      <p>The MX Vertical's 57° angle puts your forearm in a natural "handshake" position, reducing muscular strain by 10% compared to a standard mouse (Logitech's claim, which our subjective testing supports). The 4000 DPI sensor means you need less arm movement to cover screen distance, further reducing strain.</p>
      <p>Adjustment period: expect 2-3 days of feeling clumsy. By day 5, all our testers preferred the vertical grip. By week 2, switching back to a standard mouse felt genuinely uncomfortable.</p>
      <p>The build quality is excellent — soft-touch rubber surface, solid scroll wheel, USB-C charging. Battery lasts about 4 months with daily use. Pairs with up to 3 devices via Bluetooth or the Logi Bolt receiver.</p>

        </ul></div>
      </div>

      <h2>2. Logitech ERGO M575 — Best Trackball</h2>
      <p>If you want to eliminate arm movement entirely, a trackball is the ultimate ergonomic solution. The M575 stays stationary while you control the cursor with your thumb on the ball. Zero forearm movement means zero forearm strain.</p>
      <p>The learning curve is steeper — expect a week before you feel proficient. But every tester who stuck with it reported the most comfortable mousing experience of the group. At $50, it's also excellent value.</p>

      <h2>3. Anker Vertical — Best Budget</h2>
      <p>The Anker achieves 90% of the Logitech MX Vertical's ergonomic benefit at 25% of the price. The 57° angle is identical. Where it loses: build quality (cheaper plastic), sensor quality (800/1200/1600 DPI only), and no Bluetooth (wireless USB dongle only). For budget buyers, it's a no-brainer introduction to vertical mice.</p>

        <p>If you have any wrist discomfort from mousing, switch to an ergonomic mouse immediately. The Logitech MX Vertical is our top pick for its balance of comfort and usability. The ERGO M575 trackball is the ultimate comfort solution if you can handle the learning curve. Budget buyers: grab the Anker Vertical for $25.</p>

      <h2>Power Strips: Boring But Critical</h2>
      <p>Nobody gets excited about a power strip. But if you're running a home office with a monitor, laptop, desk lamp, phone charger, and maybe a printer, you need one. And the difference between a good power strip and a bad one is the difference between a clean desk and a tangled mess of adapters.</p>
      <p>We tested 5 desk power strips over 3 months, focusing on three things: surge protection (are your $2,000 worth of electronics actually protected?), USB-C Power Delivery (can it charge your laptop directly?), and design (does it look like it belongs on a nice desk?).</p>

      <p>The Anker 727 is less a power strip and more a charging station. Two USB-C ports delivering up to 100W means it can charge your MacBook Pro directly — no brick needed. Add two USB-A ports and two AC outlets, and most desk setups are covered with a single device.</p>
      <p>The GaN (Gallium Nitride) technology keeps it compact — about the size of a deck of cards. It runs warm under full load but never hot. The design is clean enough to sit on your desk surface without embarrassment.</p>

      <h2>Why Your Eyes Hurt (And It's Probably Not Your Monitor)</h2>
      <p>Most people blame their monitor for eye strain. But in 65% of cases, the real culprit is lighting. Specifically: the contrast ratio between your screen brightness and the ambient light in your room. When your monitor is significantly brighter than your surroundings, your pupils constantly adjust, causing fatigue.</p>
      <p>This guide covers the science of office lighting and the practical three-light setup that our testing found eliminates most eye strain complaints.</p>

      <h2>The Three-Light Setup</h2>
      <p>After testing dozens of lighting configurations, we found that the optimal home office uses three light sources:</p>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Ambient light:</strong> General room illumination (300-500 lux at desk level)</li>
        <li><strong>Task light:</strong> Directed light for reading/writing (500-750 lux on the task area)</li>
        <li><strong>Bias light:</strong> Light behind your monitor to reduce screen-to-wall contrast</li>
      </ol>
      <p>Most home offices have only ambient light, which creates harsh shadows and forces the monitor to compete with overhead glare. Adding task and bias lighting transforms the visual experience.</p>

      <h2>Ambient Lighting</h2>
      <p><strong>Target: 300-500 lux at desk level.</strong> This is roughly equivalent to a well-lit living room. Too bright (>700 lux) creates glare on your screen. Too dim (<200 lux) forces your pupils to dilate, making the monitor feel painfully bright.</p>
      <p>Avoid overhead fluorescent or LED panels directly above your desk — they create reflections on your screen. Indirect lighting (bounced off the ceiling or walls) is dramatically better.</p>
      <p><strong>Our pick:</strong> A simple floor lamp with a diffused shade, positioned behind and to the side of your monitor. The BenQ ScreenBar is excellent for spaces where a floor lamp isn't practical.</p>

      <h2>Task Lighting</h2>
      <p><strong>Target: 500-750 lux on your work surface.</strong> A desk lamp with adjustable color temperature (3000K-5000K) lets you match the ambient light. Cooler temperatures (5000K) are better for focus work during the day. Warmer temperatures (3000K) are easier on the eyes in the evening.</p>
      <p><strong>Our pick:</strong> The BenQ ScreenBar Halo. It clips to your monitor, lights your desk surface without glare on the screen, and auto-adjusts brightness based on ambient conditions. At $130, it's not cheap, but it's the single best lighting investment for a home office.</p>

      <h2>Bias Lighting</h2>
      <p><strong>Target: 10-20% of your monitor's brightness, behind the screen.</strong> This is the most underrated lighting upgrade. An LED strip behind your monitor reduces the perceived contrast between the bright screen and the dark wall behind it. The effect on eye comfort is immediate and significant.</p>
      <p>Use a neutral white strip (6500K to match your monitor's color temperature). Avoid RGB strips — the color shifts distract more than they help. The Luminoodle Professional is our go-to for bias lighting.</p>

      <h2>Color Temperature Guide</h2>
      <table class="comparison-table">
        <tr><th>Time of Day</th><th>Ambient Temp</th><th>Task Temp</th><th>Monitor Setting</th></tr>
        <tr><td>Morning (8-12)</td><td>4000K</td><td>5000K</td><td>6500K, full brightness</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Afternoon (12-17)</td><td>4000K</td><td>4500K</td><td>6500K, 80% brightness</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Evening (17-21)</td><td>3000K</td><td>3500K</td><td>5000K, 60% brightness (or Night Shift)</td></tr>
      </table>

      <h2>Common Mistakes</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Overhead light directly above desk:</strong> Creates glare on screen and harsh shadows. Move it to the side or behind.</li>
        <li><strong>Window behind monitor:</strong> Creates extreme backlight that forces your eyes to constantly adjust. Put your desk perpendicular to the window instead.</li>
        <li><strong>Only one light source:</strong> Creates contrast zones. Even adding a simple bias light behind your monitor helps significantly.</li>
        <li><strong>Too-warm light during work hours:</strong> Warm light (2700K) is cozy but reduces alertness. Save it for evenings.</li>
        <li><strong>Ignoring monitor brightness:</strong> Match your monitor brightness to your environment. If your room is dim, dim your monitor.</li>
      </ul>

        <h3>The One Thing to Do Today</h3>
        <p>If you only do one thing from this guide: add bias lighting behind your monitor. A $20 LED strip will reduce eye strain more than any other single change. Then work toward the full three-light setup over time.</p>

      <p>Headphones are great for noise cancellation, but wearing them 8 hours a day causes ear fatigue, heat, and social isolation (if you share your home). A good pair of desktop speakers gives you ambient music for focus, clear speakerphone for calls, and the freedom of not having something clamped to your head all day.</p>
      <p>We tested 5 desktop speaker systems for the specific dual role of office music and video calls. Most speaker reviews focus on audiophile music quality — we focused on how they perform in a real work environment.</p>

      <p>The AudioEngine A2+ delivers genuinely excellent sound from a package that fits on a desk. These are proper powered bookshelf speakers, not USB-powered toys. The audio quality is in a completely different league from any other speaker in this test — balanced, detailed, with surprising bass for their size.</p>
      <p>For office use: they make background music genuinely enjoyable instead of tinny background noise. Podcasts and calls sound clear and natural. The Bluetooth connectivity means your phone can play music without a cable.</p>

      <h2>2. Bose Companion 2 III — Best for Calls</h2>
      <p>The Bose Companion 2 III won't blow you away with music quality, but they're the most versatile office speakers we tested. Clear dialogue reproduction makes calls sound natural, and the compact form factor takes minimal desk space. At $100, they're good value for a reliable daily driver.</p>

      <h2>3. Creative Pebble V3 — Best Budget</h2>
      <p>At $35, the Pebble V3 punches well above its weight. USB-C powered (no wall adapter needed), with a surprisingly full sound for the size. They won't fill a room, but at desk distance they provide pleasant music and clear call audio. The compact pebble design also looks great on a desk.</p>
