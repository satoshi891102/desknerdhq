      <h2>Why Your Desk Needs a Plant</h2>
      <p>A 2024 study from the University of Technology Sydney found that office plants reduced stress by 37%, depression by 58%, anger by 44%, and fatigue by 38%. A separate NASA study identified certain plants as effective air purifiers, removing formaldehyde, benzene, and trichloroethylene from indoor air.</p>
      <p>The problem: most office environments have low to moderate light (200-500 lux), no direct sunlight, and inconsistent watering from busy workers. These 8 plants don't just survive those conditions — they genuinely thrive in them.</p>

      <h2>Our Top 8 Office Desk Plants</h2>

      <h3>1. Pothos (Epipremnum aureum) — Best Overall</h3>
      <p><strong>Light:</strong> Low to bright indirect | <strong>Water:</strong> When soil is dry (every 1-2 weeks) | <strong>Size:</strong> Trailing vine, trim to any size</p>
      <p>Pothos is the ultimate office plant. It tolerates low light, irregular watering, fluorescent lighting, and temperature swings. The trailing vines look beautiful draped from a shelf or hanging planter. If you forget to water it for 3 weeks, it'll wilt dramatically — water it, and it bounces back within hours. It's virtually unkillable.</p>
      <p><strong>Pro tip:</strong> Pothos grows faster in bright indirect light but survives fine in near-darkness. We kept one in a windowless conference room for 6 months — it grew slowly but remained healthy.</p>

      <h3>2. Snake Plant (Sansevieria) — Best for Neglect</h3>
      <p><strong>Light:</strong> Low to bright | <strong>Water:</strong> Every 2-6 weeks | <strong>Size:</strong> 6"-4 feet depending on variety</p>
      <p>If you want a plant you can genuinely forget about, the Snake Plant is your answer. It stores water in its thick leaves and can go 4-6 weeks between waterings. It tolerates everything from near-darkness to bright light. The upright growth habit makes it perfect for desk corners without taking horizontal space.</p>
      <p><strong>Bonus:</strong> NASA identified Snake Plants as one of the best air purifiers, removing formaldehyde, benzene, and nitrogen oxides at night (most plants only clean air during the day).</p>

      <h3>3. ZZ Plant (Zamioculcas zamiifolia) — Most Stylish</h3>
      <p><strong>Light:</strong> Low to moderate | <strong>Water:</strong> Every 2-3 weeks | <strong>Size:</strong> 2-3 feet</p>
      <p>The ZZ Plant's glossy, dark green leaves look almost artificial — in a good way. It's architecturally beautiful and incredibly low-maintenance. The rhizome root system stores water, making it drought-tolerant. It grows slowly in low light but maintains its shape and color perfectly.</p>

      <h3>4. Peace Lily (Spathiphyllum) — Best Flowering</h3>
      <p><strong>Light:</strong> Low to medium | <strong>Water:</strong> When leaves droop slightly (every 5-7 days) | <strong>Size:</strong> 1-4 feet</p>
      <p>The Peace Lily is the only plant on this list that flowers in low light. The elegant white blooms appear several times a year with minimal care. Like the Pothos, it communicates when it needs water by drooping — then perks up within hours of watering. Another NASA air purifier champion.</p>

      <h3>5. Chinese Evergreen (Aglaonema) — Most Colorful</h3>
      <p><strong>Light:</strong> Low to medium | <strong>Water:</strong> Every 1-2 weeks | <strong>Size:</strong> 1-3 feet</p>
      <p>If you want color beyond green, Chinese Evergreens come in varieties with silver, pink, red, and cream variegation. They tolerate low light (though colors are more vivid in medium light) and forgive inconsistent watering. An excellent choice for adding visual interest to a monochrome desk setup.</p>

      <h3>6-8. Honorable Mentions</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Spider Plant:</strong> Nearly indestructible, produces baby plants you can share. Excellent air purifier.</li>
        <li><strong>Philodendron:</strong> Similar to Pothos but with larger, heart-shaped leaves. Same bulletproof care requirements.</li>
        <li><strong>Lucky Bamboo:</strong> Grows in water alone (no soil needed). Minimal footprint. Looks clean on a modern desk.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>The 3 Rules of Office Plant Success</h2>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Underwater, don't overwater.</strong> More office plants die from overwatering than anything else. When in doubt, wait another few days.</li>
        <li><strong>Drain the excess.</strong> Never let plants sit in standing water. Use pots with drainage holes and saucers, or cache pots you can empty.</li>
        <li><strong>Dust the leaves monthly.</strong> Dusty leaves can't photosynthesize efficiently. A quick wipe with a damp cloth every month keeps plants healthy.</li>
      </ol>

        <div class="score-label">Category Rating</div>
        <h3>Start Here</h3>
        <p>Get a Pothos. It's $5-15 at any garden center, survives anything, and makes your desk immediately feel more alive. Once you succeed with that, add a Snake Plant and a ZZ Plant. Three plants is the sweet spot for a standard desk without it feeling like a jungle.</p>
