      <h1 class="section-title">About DeskNerdHQ</h1>
      <p>We're a small team obsessed with home office ergonomics and productivity. After spending hundreds of hours researching products for our own setups, we realized the information that actually matters — long-term durability, real-world noise levels, thermal behavior, ergonomic impact after months of use — doesn't exist in most reviews.</p>
      <p>Most review sites test products for a few days, write their impressions, and move on. We test products for months. Every standing desk goes through 500+ motor cycles. Every chair gets sat in for hundreds of hours. Every monitor stays on our desk for at least two weeks of real work.</p>
      <h2>Our Testing Philosophy</h2>
      <p><strong>We buy what we test.</strong> No manufacturer loans that get returned after a glowing review. We purchase products at retail price, use them in our actual work environments, and report honestly.</p>
      <p><strong>Time is the test.</strong> Day-one impressions are marketing. Month-three impressions are reviews. A standing desk motor that's smooth on day one but grinding on day forty-five would pass a short review. It won't pass ours.</p>
      <p><strong>We measure, not just feel.</strong> Decibel meters for noise. Digital levels for wobble. Colorimeters for monitors. Thermometers for docking stations. Subjective impressions are valuable, but they're supplemented with objective data wherever possible.</p>
      <h2>How We Make Money</h2>
      <p>We earn commissions from affiliate links. When you buy a product through our links, we receive a small percentage of the sale at no extra cost to you. This never affects our rankings — the product we recommend is the product that tested best, period. Our full policy is on our <a href="/affiliate-disclosure/">affiliate disclosure page</a>.</p>
      <p>We don't accept sponsored reviews. We don't accept payment for placement. We don't accept free products in exchange for coverage. If a company wants to send us a product, we buy our own instead.</p>
